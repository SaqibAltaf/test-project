I have assumed to get an array of different sized boxes and I have calculated the final box size such that it can hold the number of items growing verticallly (the height grows as the number of items are added) and the width and length assigned to the box is the max of width and length of the items provided.

Route:
http://localhost:3000/api/post

Data in json form

boxes:[{
    height:10,
    width:20,
    length:40
},
{
    height:10,
    width:20,
    length:40
}]


Happy Coding :)
